This document specifies the format for the input file (FA.in) that defines a finite automaton.

### EBNF Definition:
finite_automaton = 
    "states:" states_list "
" 
    "alphabet:" alphabet_list "
" 
    "transitions:" transitions_list "
" 
    "final_states:" final_states_list "
" ;

states_list = state { "," state } ;
state = letter { letter | digit } ;

alphabet_list = symbol { "," symbol } ;
symbol = letter ;

transitions_list = "(" state "," symbol "," state ")" { ", (" state "," symbol "," state ")" } ;

final_states_list = state { "," state } ;


### Explanation of Components:
1. **states**: A list of all states in the automaton.
2. **alphabet**: A list of all symbols in the automaton's alphabet.
3. **transitions**: A list of transition rules. Each rule is represented as `(current_state, input_symbol, next_state)`.
4. **final_states**: A list of all final or accepting states.
